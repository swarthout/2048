2048
====
This is a side project I am working on just for fun. I hope to create a replica of the hit mobile game and then make some cool side applications for it like a program that can play the game. I hope to eventually make a program that can beat my math teacher at 2048!

Note: For this to work on your computer, you need to have NumPy for Python 3.3 and tkinter for Python 3.3 installed.
